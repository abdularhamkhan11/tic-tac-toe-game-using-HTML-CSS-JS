# tic-tac-toe-game-using-HTML-CSS-JS
A Tic Tac Toe game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun project that involves creating an interactive two-player game where users can take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three marks (either X's or O's) in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent does. Here's a description of how you can build a basic Tic Tac Toe game with these three technologies.

Description:
This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a dynamic and interactive experience. The grid is made using HTML, the styling is applied using CSS, and the game logic and interactivity are handled through JavaScript.

Features:
Game Grid: A 3x3 grid is created using HTML and styled using CSS.

Player Turns: The game alternates between two players (X and O), with each player clicking on an empty square to place their mark.

Winning Condition: The game checks for winning conditions after each move (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal).

Draw Condition: If all squares are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

Reset Function: The game can be reset after a win or draw, allowing for multiple rounds of play.

Code Breakdown:
HTML: Structures the grid of squares and buttons.

CSS: Styles the grid, buttons, and the game layout.

JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including player turns, checking for a winner, and resetting the game.
